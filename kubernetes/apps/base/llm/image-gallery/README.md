# Image Gallery

This deploys a simple image gallery to view generated images from ComfyUI.

## Purpose

Provides a web interface to view images generated by ComfyUI that are stored on the NFS share at `voyager.internal:/mnt/akademiya/comfyui/output`.

## Features

- Simple nginx-based image gallery with auto-indexing
- Serves images from the NFS share where ComfyUI outputs are stored
- Accessible via `images.jory.dev`

## Architecture

Uses the app-template Helm chart with:
- NFS volume mount from `voyager.internal:/mnt/akademiya/comfyui/output`
- nginx server with autoindex enabled
- Read-only access to prevent modifications to image files
