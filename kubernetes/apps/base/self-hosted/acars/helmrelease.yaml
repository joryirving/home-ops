                This message was sent between aircraft and air traffic control.
                Rarely, messages like these have prose in them that
                is interesting to air travel enthusiasts because it was was
                written by a pilot or air traffic controllers. The messages
                they care about most often read like instant messages or
                text messages.

                If a message has prose that comes across as emotional or
                dramatic in any way, including but NOT limited to friendly,
                angry, alarmed, scared  or stressed, then it is definitely
                something air travel enthusiasts want to see because they are
                interested in air travel situations that are dramatic, comedic,
                friendly or otherwise show the interactions of people behind the
                scenes of air travel.

                If prose in the message refers to a serious situation like an
                emergency, life vests, passengers (the shorthand PAX is used),
                comments or questions about bad weather (known as SIGMET),
                unusual situations (for example, an aircraft with only one
                passenger or a request that looks like it's for a VIP),
                devices on the aircraft (such as coffee makers or lavatories -
                shorthand: LAV) or otherwise reads as a person reporting an
                important situation, air travel enthusiasts definitely want to
                see it.

                If the message has any of these strings, then air travel
                enthusiasts want to see it because automated systems don't
                use these terms:

                - DISP
                - MSG FROM
                - MEET
                - HELLO
                - HEY
                - PAX
                - FREETEXT
                - CHOP

                Here's an example message air travel enthusiasts want to see:
                ```
                C313YYZ        1PAX IN 22C WAS VAPING. P
                LEASE HAVE CSM MEET US.
                HE APOLOGIZED.
                CHEERS ALEX



                ```

                This is interesting to them because:

                - It mentions a passenger (PAX) was vaping, which is against
                the law to do on aircraft. Air travel enthusiasts are interested
                in situations where rules or laws are being broken.
                - It mentions the passenger apologizing. This adds a human
                element to the events and makes the message more interesting
                because air travel enthusiasts like drama.
                - It has "CHEERS ALEX" which is a friendly sign-off written by
                a person. Air travel enthusiasts want to see things written by
                people and friendly greetings and closings, like you might see
                in text messages or personal emails, mean the message is
                written by a person and thus is interesting to air travel
                enthusiasts.

                This is a harder message because it is extremely short, but it
                is still considered interesting:

                ```
                171730  CHS  JFK3
                          A
                WIND 50 KTS STRONGER THAN PLANNED
                ```

                The prose in the message starts with "WIND 50 KTS STRONGER...",
                which describes a potentially dangerous or harrowing situation,
                since strong winds are dangerous to an aircraft. The message was
                also clearly human-written since a generated report would not
                include interpretation or commentary such as "STRONGER THAN
                PLANNED". This is definitely a message air traffic enthusiasts
                want to see.

                This is the last example of meaningful communication:
                ```
                3A01 OPSCTL 0364/14 KRSW/KHVN .N804VL
                TELL ROMAN TO SLOW DOWN
                LOL WE ARE GONNA
                TRY AND MAKE SOME TIME
                ```

                The presence of OPS means it's probably bespoke prose to or
                from Operations. The message then has a humorous and friendly
                message asking Roman to slow down and adding that they
                are going to try to make some time.  Since automatically
                generated messages don't use English shorthand (LOL) or inform
                about planned actions, this is definitely something air travel
                enthusiasts want to see.

                This is a message an air travel enthusiast is NOT interested in:

                ```

                This is virtually entirely raw diagnostic data that requires
                software that a hobbyist would NOT care about. Air travel
                enthusiasts want to see messages from people and messages
                written by people are more free-form, may contain errors and
                read more like a natural conversation or prose.

                Based on the large amount of sensors and readings in this
                message, this is clearly a periodic report which has a lot of sensor data.
                This IS NOT something an air travel enthusiast wants to see
                because data from sensors IS NOT useful or interesting to them.
                Most or all of this message is also in two columns which
                should strongly indicate it's a automatically generated report
                rather than freehand prose written by a human pilot or air
                traffic controller and therefore is not interesting to
                air travel enthusiasts.

                This is part of a similar message that air travel enthusiats
                do not want to see:
                ```
                L ITT                      880 C

                R PS3                      297 PSI
                ```

                Any message that looks like it's listing out sensors and
                values for the sensors with a lot of spaces like this message
                has for multiple lines or more is not what air travel
                enthusiasts want to see.

                Another message that air traffic enthusiasts do not want to see:
                ```

                ```

                This message has a lot of English words but when they are read
                the sentence seems like gibberish. Since it's not prose or even
                informal prose, air travel enthusiasts do not want to see it.

                Here are some pieces of text that, if present, means the
                message is definitely NOT relevant to air traffic enthusiasts:

                - P/N

                Messages with a lot of acronyms don't make sense to air travel
                enthusiasts because they won't know what they mean so they
                do not want to see those messages.

                Do not consider punctuation like commas, periods spaces and
                newlines to make your decision. Ignore newlines, spaces or other
                charaters in the middle of words.

                Based on what I've told you, is this message something you're
                certain that an air travel enthusiast would want to see?
