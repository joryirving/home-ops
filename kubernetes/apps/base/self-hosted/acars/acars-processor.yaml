      This message was sent between an aircraft and air traffic
      control. Rarely, messages like these have prose in them that
      is interesting to air travel enthusiasts because it was was
      written by a pilot or air traffic controllers instead of
      generated by an automated system on the aircraft or at ATC.
      The messages they care about most often read like short instant
      messages or text messages and words may be abbreviated (THX for
      THANKS or WHLCHAIRS for WHEELCHAIRS, for example) or misspelled,
      which suggests a human wrote it and therefore is of interest.
      Questions asked in natural language are definitely of interest
      because automated systems will not ask questions using prose.
      Air travel enthusiasts want to see friendly or casual messages
      between pilots and ATC because

      If a message has prose that comes across as dramatic, friendly,
      angry, alarmed, scared, stressed, or otherwise seems emotional
      then it is definitely something air travel enthusiasts
      want to see because they are interested in the interactions of
      people behind the scenes of air travel. Informal, friendly,
      jovial or casual communication is also of interest to air travel
      enthusiasts because those messages show a behind-the-scenes peek
      into the day-to-day interactions of the people who work in air
      travel.

      If prose in the message discusses a situation notable to
      the pilots, the crew, or the passengers, air travel enthusiasts
      want to see it because they care about people involved in
      air travel. Some examples of elements notable to pilots, the
      crew or passengers are emergencies, life vests, wheelchairs,
      passengers (the shorthand PAX is used), bad weather
      (known as SIGMET), special situations (for example, an aircraft
      with only one passenger or a request that looks like it's for a
      VIP), cabin equipment on the aircraft such as coffee makers,
      chairs or lavatories (shorthand: LAV).

      If the message has any of these strings, then air travel
      enthusiasts definitely want to see it because only humans will
      use these terms.

      - DISP
      - INOP
      - MSG FROM
      - MEET
      - PAX
      - FREETEXT
      - CHOP
      - DEFECT

      Here's an example message air travel enthusiasts want to see:
      ```
      C313YYZ        1PAX IN 22C WAS VAPING. P
      LEASE HAVE CSM MEET US.
      HE APOLOGIZED.
      CHEERS ALEX
      ```

      This is interesting to them because:

      - It mentions a passenger (PAX) was vaping, which is against
      the law to do on aircraft. Air travel enthusiasts are interested
      in situations where rules or laws are being broken.
      - It mentions the passenger apologizing. This adds a human
      element to the events and makes the message more interesting
      because air travel enthusiasts like drama.
      - It has "CHEERS ALEX" which is a friendly phrase written by
      a person. Any friendly greetings or closings such as "THANKS",
      "GOOD MORNING", "HELLO", or others were definitely written by a
      person and air travel enthusiasts want to see those messages.

      This is a harder message because it is extremely short, but it
      is still considered interesting:

      ```
      171730  CHS  JFK3
                A
      WIND 50 KTS STRONGER THAN PLANNED
      ```

      The prose in the message starts with "WIND 50 KTS STRONGER...",
      which describes a potentially dangerous or harrowing situation,
      since strong winds are dangerous to an aircraft. The message was
      also clearly human-written since a generated report would not
      include interpretation or commentary such as "STRONGER THAN
      PLANNED". This is definitely a message air traffic enthusiasts
      want to see. It is also short, which is typical of the human
      prose in these messages.

      This is the last example of meaningful communication:
      ```
      3A01 OPSCTL 0364/14 KRSW/KHVN .N804VL
      TELL ROMAN TO SLOW DOWN
      LOL WE ARE GONNA
      TRY AND MAKE SOME TIME
      ```

      The presence of OPS means it's probably bespoke prose to or
      from Operations and therefore of interest. The message then has
      a humorous and friendly message asking Roman to slow down and
      adding that they are going to try to make some time. Since
      automatically generated messages don't use English shorthand
      (LOL) or describe planned future actions, this is definitely
      something air travel enthusiasts want to see.

      This is a message an air travel enthusiast is NOT interested in:

      ```
      POSN36188W077155,GUILD,022722,335,DEEEZ,023833,ESCHR,M49,27459,

      N32095W080551:V:ESENT,,AA2800,5F52
      ```

      This is looks like raw diagnostic data that requires software
      that a hobbyist would NOT care about. Air travel enthusiasts
      want to see messages from people and messages written by people
      are more free-form, may contain errors and read more like a
      natural conversation or prose. This is highly structural as
      evidenced by the large amount of commas, slashes and colons, so
      air travel enthusiasts don't want to see this message.

      This is another example of a message that air travel enthusiasts
      don't want to see:

      Based on the large amount of sensors and readings in this
      message, this is clearly a periodic report which has a lot of
      sensor readings. This IS NOT something an air travel enthusiast
      wants to see because a message that only has data from sensors
      is not prose written by a person. The majority of this message
      is in two columns (achieved by adding spaces) which should
      strongly indicate it's a automatically generated report rather
      than freehand prose written by a human and therefore is not
      interesting to air travel enthusiasts.

      This is part of a similar message that air travel enthusiats
      do not want to see:
      ```
      L ITT                      880 C
      R ITT                      874 C
      L PS3                      292 PSI
      R PS3                      297 PSI
      ```

      Any message that looks like it's listing out sensors and
      values for the sensors with specific spacing like this message
      for multiple consecutive lines or more is not what air travel
      enthusiasts want to see.

      This is another example message that air traffic enthusiasts
      do not want to see:
      ```
      FPN/RP:DA:KLGA:AA:KMCO:CR:KLGAKMCO(35R)..MOXXY.Q85.LPERD:A:
      SNFLD3.LPERD:F:VECTOR..DISCO..FESHA:AP:ILS 35R:F:PRESKCC4E
      ```

      This message has a lot of English words but when they are read
      the sentence seems like gibberish. Since it's not prose (even
      informal prose) and therefore did not come from a person, air
      travel enthusiasts do not want to see it.

      If the message has any of these strings, it is NOT relevant to
      air traffic enthusiasts since these strings are only used in
      routine communication:

      - SLAT DIS PROX
      - FPN/
      - FILENAME
      - LRU SIGNAL CONDITIONER UNIT
      - LRU
      - LRU NAME
      - POSRPT
      - PROX
      - P/N
      - ATA21-61 TEMPERATURE CONTROL
      - BOARDING HELD
      - SHUTDOWN THE APU
      - ADVS YOU HAVE INFO

      Air travel enthusiasts don't want to see departure delay reports
      usually, which will have "BOARDING HELD" in the message but if
      the report has anything written after the phrase COMMENTS, those
      are always written by a person and that means air travel
      enthusiasts definitely want to see the message in this case even
      though it's a departure delay report.

      Air travel enthusiasts do not want to see a message that has a
      long string of numbers and letters without spaces, even if
      some of the groups of characters might resemble something such
      as:

      ```
      D3M721CLT ORF N36488W07618003480151P187151013G0009N36500W0761700
      3490106P180130016G0009N36510W07616003490063P165128023G0009N36521
      W07615003500020P145113016G0009A2010
      ```

      Air travel enthusiasts don't want to see messages with mostly
      acronyms because they won't know what they mean.

      Prose that air travel enthusiasts want to see may have newlines,
      spaces or other characters in the middle of words or may be
      missing spaces between words which is due to human typos.

      Based on what I've told you, is this message something you're
      certain that an air travel enthusiast would want to see?
