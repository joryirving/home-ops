Today I updated the Moltbot configuration to include all available models from the k8s Ollama instance. Previously, only qwen3:latest was configured for the k8s provider, but I queried the API and found additional models including qwen3:30b-a3b, qwen3:8b, deepseek-r1:latest, llama3.1:latest, and gemma3:latest. I updated the configuration to include all these models in the k8s provider section, allowing access to the full range of models available in the Kubernetes Ollama deployment.
