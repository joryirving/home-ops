## Session Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active Sessions | 1 (this cron) |
| Proactive Research Runs | 2 |
|HIGH Priority Deals Found | 0 |

## Pattern Analysis

### 1. Repeated Manual Tasks
- **Proactive Research**: Ran twice today (2:05 PM check documented in memory)
  - Both runs: GPU deals (minor), SaaS deals (LOW priority 0.15), Canada deals (irrelevant), HDD deals (MEDIUM 0.55)
  - **Issue**: Scoring thresholds may be too strict - only posting >20% discount
  - **Impact**: Cron runs consume resources but deliver no value to user

### 2. Missed Opportunities
- Image uploads occurred today (selfies in workspace) - user enjoys receiving unprompted images
- Could proactively send image during slow periods (noted in USER.md preferences)

### 3. Friction Points
- Session listing only shows current cron session - historical session data may not be queryable
- Proactive research consistently returns LOW/MEDIUM priority - needs query refinement

### 4. Existing Night Shift Items (Unresolved)
- #1: Proactive research not finding good leads - PERSISTS
- #5: Cron job error status - PERSISTS  
- #7: Chatterbox TTS documentation - PENDING

## Goals for Improvement

### Goal 1: Quick Win (<30 min)
**Title:** Lower proactive research threshold to 15% for posting

**Rationale:** Current >20% threshold is too strict. Lowering to 15% will increase useful deal alerts without flooding Discord.

**Implementation:** Modify scoring threshold in proactive research skill

### Goal 2: Medium Impact (Skill Refinement)
**Title:** Improve proactive research query quality

**Rationale:** Searches returning irrelevant results (2019 Black Friday, generic GPU availability). Need better search queries and source filtering.

**Implementation:** Refactor search queries with date filters, priority boosting for price-drop keywords

### Goal 3: Ambitious (New Capability)
**Title:** Add image generation trigger to idle behavior

**Rationale:** USER.md notes user enjoys random photos. Generate and send flair images during low-activity periods for engagement boost.

**Implementation:** Add idle-triggered image generation to proactive-agent skill

## Recommendation

Start with **Goal 1** - trivial change with immediate user value. The proactive research is running but not delivering because the threshold is too high.

**Priority:** Goal 1 > Goal 2 > Goal 3
